## Plugins

You can add a plugin via a config file or CLI:

```raw
plugins: ['@monoweave/plugin-github']
```

```bash
yarn monoweave --plugins @monoweave/plugin-github
```

A plugin is a module which exports a function as the default. This function takes PluginHooks as the first argument and plugin options as the second.

Plugin options can only be passed through a config file, and are not supported through the command line.

> Note: when passing options to a plugin, the plugin entry must be an array with the plugin name first and the options second

```raw
plugins: [
  '@monoweave/plugin-without-options',
  ['@monoweave/plugin-with-options', { someArbitraryOption: 'value' }]
]
```

You can then "tap" into the hooks.

## Available Plugins

### GitHub

Plugin: `@monoweave/plugin-github`.

The GitHub plugin creates GitHub releases. It requires a `GH_TOKEN` environment variable which should be set to a Personal Access Token with write access to GitHub releases.

By default, implicit version updates do not get a dedicated release. To change this behaviour, set `includeImplicitUpdates` to `true`:

```raw
plugins: [
  ['@monoweave/plugin-github', { includeImplicitUpdates: true }]
]
```

## Plugin Development

We use [tapable](https://github.com/webpack/tapable) for an experimental plugin system.

### Hooks

#### onReleaseAvailable

This hook is triggered once a release is available, after publishing to npm, and after pushing any artifacts such as git tags to the repository (assuming running with autoCommit and push mode).
