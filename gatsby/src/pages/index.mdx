Monoweave is a powerful tool which aims to simplify the package publishing process for monorepos. It leverages [Yarn Modern workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces) to do the heavy lifting, and is a direct replacement for tools such as [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).

Monoweave only supports projects using Yarn Modern with the minimum node version set to Node v18.12.

## Usage

```bash
yarn add -D @monoweave/cli
yarn monoweave --dry-run
```

Although we don't recommend it in production, you can use monoweave directly from the git repository:

```bash
yarn add -D @monoweave/cli@monoweave/monoweave#workspace=@monoweave/cli
```
